How to request and respond from a server to computer or mobile means browsers.

=> we have 2 techies: 1 Express 
                      2 Mongoose

Express works as a request send and recieve.
mongoose works as a data-base.

When we visit any url eg. Postman it decides to response us and gives this so anyone would be require to respond us means to listen us.

This is called /:home route.
/login:login setup.

Means sunne wala kaam hota hai wo express karte hai. 

Requests: get()
Response: post()

=>after the json file is made than how to run the index file?
To run it make a new file index.js we can run it in terminal by writing node index.js

But now how to run it from package.json?
Here we make script commands in json file.

Add one command in script start:"node index.js"  it is useful when we go to browser.

Now to install express write :
npm i express in terminal.

---------DEPLOY---------
whne we deploy our app we dont want to show some sensite info so will install one package again
 npm i env
